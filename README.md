# Uncommon Expo CLI Configuration Errors

This repository demonstrates an example of uncommon errors encountered when using Expo CLI.  These errors often stem from subtle misconfigurations within the project setup, leading to vague and difficult-to-diagnose issues.  The example focuses on dependency mismatches and missing native modules.

## Problem

Expo CLI projects can encounter errors due to mismatched dependency versions (React Native, Expo SDK, etc.) or missing native modules that are not explicitly defined in the project configuration.  The error messages are often not very helpful in pinpointing the exact cause.

## Solution

The solution typically involves carefully reviewing the `package.json` file, ensuring that all dependencies are compatible with the Expo SDK version and that the project's configuration aligns with the required native modules.  Sometimes, reinstalling packages or cleaning the project's cache is helpful.
