This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has an incorrect or outdated configuration.  Specifically, it might be related to mismatched versions of Expo modules, incorrect dependencies listed in package.json, or missing native modules.  The error messages are often vague and unhelpful, requiring close inspection of the project setup and package files. Example:  An error might state that a module cannot be found or that there's a mismatch between the version of React Native and the Expo SDK.
