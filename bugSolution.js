The solution involves a careful review of the project configuration and dependency versions in `package.json`.  It is crucial to ensure that all packages are compatible.  Sometimes, simply reinstalling packages with `expo install` can resolve dependency conflicts.  Cleaning the cache might also be necessary.  If the issue persists, meticulously examine the error messages and check the documentation for your Expo SDK version for clues. For example, a missing native module might need to be explicitly linked.

// Example of inspecting package.json

// Check for dependency conflicts between React Native, the Expo SDK, and other packages.
// Ensure the version compatibility across packages.
// Check for missing packages.

// Example of reinstalling packages
expo install

// Example of cleaning the cache
expo prebuild --clean
